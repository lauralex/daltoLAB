# daltoLAB
A project with the purpose of aiding color-blind people by correcting the pixel colors of the entire display in "real-time".
## Current state
The main python file will contain some sample code to output a color-corrected image (starting from an input image): this is a prototype with the purpose of calibrating some constants and thresholds based on the perception of a specific subject.

## Roadmap
- [x] Simple prototype that implements the LAB color correction algorithm
- [ ] Color correction algorithm enhancement. Also, some input prompts to facilitate the calibration phase.
- [ ] LUT generation
- [ ] ICC color profile generation, starting from previously generated LUT
- [ ] Code cleanup
